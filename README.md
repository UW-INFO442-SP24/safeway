The SDG that we will be focusing on is Sustainable Cities and Communities. According to the UN website, this SDG focuses on how to make cities “inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.” The website suggests that we form a vision for our buildings, neighborhoods, and cities and then proceed to act upon that vision. The idea of making cities safer relates to our project idea, in which we will be focusing on prioritizing the safety of children, especially younger children whose safety may be at risk as they commute to school. Therefore, our guiding question is: ***"How might we improve the safety of children commuting to and from school in Seattle?"***

Our solution is a website catered to the parents of elementary school aged students in Seattle. Due to safety concerns, parents may not feel comfortable allowing their younger children to walk to/from school alone. Our website will offer parents who may not have the capacity to walk their students to/from school every day the opportunity to find other parents who are willing to walk a group of students to/from school. Through our solution, we hope to create a safe and sustainable commuting community for elementary school aged students.

Some of our key features include:
* Event Page: Our event page will include a search bar, boxes for each event, filters, a create an event button, a join button, and a color-changing feature based on how many spots are left in each event. We will be using HTML, CSS, and React in JavaScript on this page.
